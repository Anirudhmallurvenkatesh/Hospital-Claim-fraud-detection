Fraud Detection in Health Insurance Claims: Bridging the Gap 
*Note : FP – False Positive | FN – False Negative www.actuariesindia.org
• Incidence of frauds is significantly less than the 
total number of claims – class imbalance
• Ever evolving nature of fraudulent claims
• Costs of the two types of classification errors (FP* 
and FN*) are not the same
Complications – The Gap / Trigger
• There are a variety of fraud 
patterns:
• Fraud by healthcare providers
• Fraud by Insurance subscribers
• Conspiracy frauds or nexus of 
providers, customers and 
distribution channels
• Rule-based and manual fraud 
detection approach results is a lot of 
false investigations
Situation – Current State
• We are able to detect 100% of the 
fraudulent claims
• We are able to minimize the 
incorrect fraud classifications –
i.e. minimize both FP* and FN*
Desired Future State
• Is there adequate data, i.e. data depth?
• Is the data clean and usable, i.e. data quality?
• Data system sophistication and preparedness
